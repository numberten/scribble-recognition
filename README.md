Scribble Recognition
====================

An attempt to use machine learning to recognize handwritten words and translate them into correct unicode equivalents.

Steps:
------
   - Research appropriate machine learning algorithms.
   - Implement machine learning algorithm on basic set.
      - Create neural networks with the ability to expand to n layers with m neurons per layer.
      - Apply back propagation to neural networks.
      - Train feed forward neural networks to act as logic gates.
   - Implement machine learning algorithm on training set.
      - Gather images to be used for training set.
      - Standardize input characters.
      - Generate receptors to be used as neural network input.
      - Train neural networks using training set.
   - Implement machine learning algorithm on real world set.
      - Predict new characters using trained neural networks.
   - Profit
